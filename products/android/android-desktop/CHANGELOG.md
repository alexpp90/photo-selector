# Changelog — Android Desktop

Notable changes to Android Desktop, released under the tags `android-desktop-vX.Y.Z`.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this product adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). History before per-product releases: the root `CHANGELOG.md`.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- A failed undo (a move that could not be put back, a file that could not leave the trash) stays on the undo stack, so you can try again instead of losing it.
- The app no longer requests any Android permission. A library that was never used had added wake-lock, network-state, boot-completed and foreground-service permissions to the installed app.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-10-20

### Changed
- The app is now called Frameduel (formerly PhotoSelector Studio), in the launcher, Settings and the store listing.
- New app icon, including a themed icon for Android 13+ home screens.
- GitHub releases are now titled "Frameduel X.Y.Z". If you filter release titles in Obtainium, update the filter to `^Frameduel `.
- New colours: a lavender accent replaces the cyan one, and the dark surfaces around your photos are now neutral grey with no colour cast. Keeper amber, score colours and error colours are unchanged.
- Release builds include native symbol tables, so crashes in image analysis can be diagnosed.

### Fixed
- The Privacy Policy, Legal Notice and Source Code links in Settings open real pages again; they pointed at addresses that did not exist.
- The guide and score readouts no longer list an AI aesthetic score; the app has measured technical quality only since on-device AI scoring was removed.
